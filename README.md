# Handwashing Impact Analysis

This project analyzes historical medical records (1841–1849) from the Vienna General Hospital to evaluate Dr. Semmelweis's discovery: that introducing handwashing drastically reduced maternal mortality.

### Key Components
- Monthly and yearly trends in births and deaths by clinic
- Calculation of death percentage per birth
- Comparison of mortality rates before and after June 1847
- Visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib:
  - Line plots
  - KDE and histogram distributions
  - Boxplots
- Statistical testing using t-test to confirm significance of mortality reduction

### Goal
Reproduce and quantify the historical impact of handwashing practices using exploratory data analysis and basic inferential statistics.

### Tools
- Python, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
